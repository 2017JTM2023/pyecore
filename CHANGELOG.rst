Changelog
---------

0.1.0

**Features**

- Improved performances on big files deserialization (2x faster). This new
  version relies on descriptor instead of ``__getattribute__/__setattr__``.
  The code is not more compact, but more clear and split.

- New static metamodel generator, producing code related to this new version.

- Add XML type transtyping in the static metamodel generator.


**Bugfixes**

- When an ``eOpposite`` feature was set on an element, the actual opposite
  reference ``eOpposite`` was not updated.

- Subpackages managements for the static metamodel generator. The
  ``eSubpackages`` and ``eSuperPackage`` variables were not placed in the
  package, but in the module.


**Miscellaneous**

- Update bad examples in the README.rst


0.0.10-3
