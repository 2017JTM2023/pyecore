Changelog
---------

0.1.2
+++++

**Bugfixes**

- Only the default ``to_string`` method on EDataType was called, even if a new
  one was passed as parameter. The issue was a simple typo in the ``__init__``
  method.

- The EBoolean EDataType was missing a dedicated ``to_string`` method. This
  issue introduced a 'desync' between XMI that EMF Java can read and PyEcore.
  In cas of EBoolean, the serialized value was either ``True`` or ``False``
  which is not understood by Java (only ``true`` or ``false``, lower case).


0.1.1
+++++

**Features**

- Improved performances on big files deserialization (2x faster). This new
  version relies on descriptor instead of ``__getattribute__/__setattr__``.
  The code is not more compact, but more clear and split.

- New static metamodel generator, producing code related to this new version.

- Add XML type transtyping in the static metamodel generator.


**Bugfixes**

- When an ``eOpposite`` feature was set on an element, the actual opposite
  reference ``eOpposite`` was not updated.

- Subpackages managements for the static metamodel generator. The
  ``eSubpackages`` and ``eSuperPackage`` variables were not placed in the
  package, but in the module.


**Miscellaneous**

- Update bad examples in the README.rst


0.0.10-3
++++++++
